#+title: Exercism Solutions
#+author: Jordan Bell

A simple repo holding backups to all my [[https://exercism.org/][Exercism]] exercises (a great service that you should totally use).

In the name of practicing more programming and exploring more programming languages, I'm committing to at least one commit a day in 2026 across my projects, which includes the solutions found here.

For posterity, my general workflow is to:

1) Create a viable solution to an exercise, and submit to Exercism
2) Let the [[https://exercism.org/blog/sync-to-github][GitHub Syncer]] submit a pull request with the solution
3) Annotate with any minor notes from what I learned on the exercise
4) Approve and merge
